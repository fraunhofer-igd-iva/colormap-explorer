### Overview

This tool gives an overview on different colormaps by separating them into different filtered views.
The vector field indicates the distance between adjacent tiles, measured in delta E distance in CAM02-UCS 
as published in "Uniform Colour Spaces Based on CIECAM02 Colour Appearance Model" (Luo et al).
